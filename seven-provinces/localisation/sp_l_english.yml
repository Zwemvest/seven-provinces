 sp_flavor_80yw.1.d1:0 "Resentment towards the Spanish authority and religious tension in the Low Countries have been cause for agitation. \n The first has been articulated by the Dutch through their rationale that [Root.Monarch.GetName] was surrounded by evil advisors. This has developed into an overarching discontent against the absolutist Spanish regime. Another major concern involved the heavy taxation imposed on the Dutch, while support and guidance from the government is hampered by the size of our empire. The Dutch provinces have been continually acting without permission from the throne, claiming it is impractical for them to gain permission for actions, as requests sent to the throne would take at least four weeks. \n Religious resistance, on the other hand, comes with the imposition of an ecclesiastical hierarchy for all of the Spanish territories. This has created resistance in our Dutch provinces, which have already embraced the Reformation. The Reformation produced a number of Protestant denominations, which gained followers in the Seventeen Provinces. These included the Lutheran movement of Martin Luther, the Anabaptist movement of the Dutch reformer Menno Simons, and the Reformed teachings of John Calvin. \n The Dutch have now asked our governer for some concessions in policy, and we can either choose to grant these concessions, or institute harsh measures against the Dutch.

 sp_flavor_80yw.50.d1:0 "The Compromise of Nobles was a covenant of members of the lesser nobility in the Habsburg Netherlands who came together to submit a petition to the Regent Margaret of Parma, governor of the Netherlands, with the objective of obtaining a moderation of the placards against heresy in the Netherlands. \n If we accept the promised reforms of these rebels, it'll dampen the authority of church and crown. Our other option is to dispose of the governor, appoint the Duke of Alba as governor, and march in some armies to show that the crown will not bend to these beggers."
 sp_flavor_80yw.50.d2:0 "The lesser nobility in the Low Countries has come together to submit a petition to our local governor in the Netherlands, with the objective of obtaining a moderation of the placards against heresy in the Netherlands. \n Though our governor lacks the right to negotiate these kind of treaties, the lack of military authority of the governor means reforms where promised regardless. If we accept the promised reforms of these rebels, it'll dampen the authority of church and crown. Our other option is to dispose of the governor, appoint a general as governor, and march in some armies to show that the crown will not bend to these beggers."

Due to the many death sentences pronounced by the tribunal, it also became known as the Council of Blood. "
 sp_flavor_80yw.51.d2:0 "The recent political and religious troubles in the Netherlands have not yet subsided, and the rebels remain turbulent. Our local governor has proposed that we could instate a \"Council of Troubles\", a council to investigate and punish the events. \nThough it would be presented as just an advisory council, to keep the locals calm, the council would need to supersede preexisting State Council, Privy Council, and Juridical Council to be of any effective measure, and ignoring the judicial privileges of the Netherlands could present even harder opposition for the Dutch. \nOne of our advisors has a different proposition; we can also instate a Council of Supervision led by the Dutch nobility, which can ensure that local rights and privileges are respected. However, this will likely mean that the Dutch will grow even more independent, and other rebel movements won't feel as intimidated by our regime."

 sp_flavor_80yw.52.d1:0 "After the failure of the compromise of the nobles a fair amount of nobles fled the country in fear of prosecution. However, two of those nobles, Egmont and van Horne, have been lured back to the country, and though they call themselves Catholics, loyal to our [This.Monarch.GetTitle], they have been very tolerant of the ongoing rebellion and spreading heresy in our country. \nOur governor considers them traitors and has arrested them, put them on trail, and judged them guilty and ordered their execution. \nWe can either let the beheading happen, which will likely spark outrage, but also show that we trust our governor and his council, or order their immediate release, which means these nobles will likely spark up more rebels across the low countries."

 sp_flavor_80yw.53.d:0 "In an effort to finance the army, our Council of Finances has proposed to the States that new taxes be introduced, among them the "Tenth Penny", a 1/10 levy on all sales other than landed property. This proposal was rejected by the States, and a compromise was subsequently agreed upon. However, our governor decided to press forward with the collection of the Tenth Penny regardless of the States' opposition. \nAmong the low countries, it has also long been a local privilege that the sovereign only levies a new tax through request. Our governor has ignored the institutions and ordered his reform for the entire Netherlands. The Netherlands threatened to be compromised as a trading nation by the Tenth Penny in their competitive mecantile position, which has again aroused strong protest from both Catholics and Protestants, and support for the rebels has grown once more, being fanned by a large group of refugees who had fled the country earlier."

Though the Low Countries have not been completely pacified, restoring the local privileges, relaxing policy, and removing governors have had the desired effect on the Low Countries, and the rebels have lost nearly all support from the Dutch upper class. The unrest in the Netherlands is dying a slow death, and in time, all will be as it was. "

 sp_flavor_80yw.61.d:0 "Several of our states of the Low Countries, though sharing little interest, have concluded a treaty in which it has been agreed that a joint effort would be made to denounce our governance, going as far as to conclude that the only way forward is to chase the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ out of the country. \nAdditionally, a number of political matters have also arranged in areas such as defense, taxes and religion, so it seems likely that the Dutch are aiming at self-government. It seems that open rebellion is now near inevitable. \nFinally, William the Silent has been travelling around, gather troops, finances, and even allies for the coming rebellion."

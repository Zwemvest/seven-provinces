 sp_flavor_80yw.1.d1:0 "Resentment towards the Spanish authority and religious tension in the Low Countries have been cause for agitation. \n The first has been articulated by the Dutch through their rationale that [Root.Monarch.GetName] was surrounded by evil advisors. This has developed into an overarching discontent against the absolutist Spanish regime. Another major concern involved the heavy taxation imposed on the Dutch, while support and guidance from the government is hampered by the size of our empire. The Dutch provinces have been continually acting without permission from the throne, claiming it is impractical for them to gain permission for actions, as requests sent to the throne would take at least four weeks. \n Religious resistance, on the other hand, comes with the imposition of an ecclesiastical hierarchy for all of the Spanish territories. This has created resistance in our Dutch provinces, which have already embraced the Reformation. The Reformation produced a number of Protestant denominations, which gained followers in the Seventeen Provinces. These included the Lutheran movement of Martin Luther, the Anabaptist movement of the Dutch reformer Menno Simons, and the Reformed teachings of John Calvin. \n The Dutch have now asked our governer for some concessions in policy, and we can either choose to grant these concessions, or institute harsh measures against the Dutch.
